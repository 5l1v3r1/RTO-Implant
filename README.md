# RTO-Implant
Red Team Operator: Malware Development Essentials Course by @Sektor7Net


For now this will just be a place holder but I plan to update it with my thought process and reason through my implementations. I went with z85 string encoding because thats semi unknown. Dynamic API resolution for the most part and a little MsgBox shellcode from the course that is mapped into notepad.exe if you have it running. The code is semi commented as is.
